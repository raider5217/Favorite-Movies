  Hello to all who tread here. I am but a humble front end newb. Still learning
  the intricacies of this wonderful markup. I'm a little older in my attempts to
  enter this foray of fun. But I really enjoy the frustration. I've been working
  very slowly (work, kids & wife) to learn HTML & CSS. I started JS last year
  and am struugleing a bit so I figured I'd go back into HTML and try to get
  myself job ready in that department. So, be gentle if you look at my pages and
  have critique. I gladly take suggestions as I'm sure you have way more
  expeience than I. Thanks and remeber <p class="dude">"The Dude abides"</p>
