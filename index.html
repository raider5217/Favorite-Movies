  This is classic movie where those who are sensitive to words should not see.
  The acting, the intense humor and the overall scope of the movie poking fun at
  a lot of different people is what makes this movie great. Mel Brooks is a
  comedy genius.

<h3>SpaceBalls</h3>

  A Star Wars parody that lives up to the spoof reputation. Instaed of Han and
  Chewie, you've got Lonestar and Barf (a Mog) a down and out duo trying to make
  money in the galaxy. They roped into trying to save the princess who happens
  to be Druish. Mel Brooks again pushes the limits of his comedies.
</p>
<h3>The whole Mission Impossible series.</h3>

  A series of action adventure stories that could very well cross into each
  other. Shows an agent and his team saving the world multiple times as he ages.
  This series is top notch action and adventure. Does not dissapoint. Great
  Story lines to go along. Toms Cruise is a great actor and equally great
  writer/director.
